# STOP Internet Explorer support

Frontend developers always struggle with supporting IE11.  
With supporting IE11 you can not develop anything in State of the art. Rather than it is State of IE11.  

There are many helpers to polyfill those gaps in old browsers and that helps a lot. Thanks to all, that make this happen. 
But it sends the wrong message and with this message we will support it until we die.

The message should be: "Stop using IE11"
